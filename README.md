# Design patterns with PlantUML

This is a workshop for software and architecture patterns, written in PlantUML.

### Notes

PlantUML tries to do both structure and styling using a single language. I
personally think that this is a bad idea that this approach greatly reduces the
readability of the documents. I write these with intent of them being consumed
as "UML as Code".
